    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
   
    <h2>HTML Paragraph Display</h2>
   
    <p>You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
    Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.<br>
    With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.<br>
    The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:</p>
    
    <p>
    This paragraph
    contains a lot of lines
    in the source code,
    but the browser
    ignores it.
    </p>
    
    <p><i>
    This paragraph
    contains         a lot of spaces
    in the source         code,
    but the        browser
    ignores it.</i>
    </p>
    

    <h2>1. The HTML line break.</h2>
    
    <p>The HTML <'br'> element defines a line break. <br>
    Use <'br'> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragrap</p>
    <p><i>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</i></p>
    
    <h2>2. HTML Horizontal Rules</h2>
    
    <p><u>Here comes the Horizontal Rule, The <"hr"> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page,<br>
     and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.</u></p>
    <p>The <"hr"> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:</p>
    
    <h3>This is heading 1</h3>
    <p>This is some text.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>This is heading 2</h3>
    <p>This is some other text.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>3. The HTML <"pre"> Element</h2>
    <p>The HTML <"pre"> element defines preformatted text.

    The text inside a <"pre"> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier),
    <br> and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:</p>
    <pre>
        <"pre">
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

            My Bonnie lies over the sea.

            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

            Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
